# java_circle_draw
I created this Java program in my Java Programming II course at ACC. This program manipulates the RGB values of image files to draw a circle on top of an image, allowing the user to define the radius of the circle. Most of the program was created by my professor, Richard Baldwin. I added the code in ImageProcessor02.java that drew the circle on top of the image (Lines 123-180).
